# Tic-Tac-Toe DFA Simulation

This project models the game state transitions of **Tic-Tac-Toe** using a **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**. It was developed as part of my **Theory of Computation** course to demonstrate the application of automata theory in real-world scenarios like game design.

## Features
- **DFA Diagram**: Visual representation of valid game moves and transitions.
- **Python Simulation**: Code that simulates the game state transitions.
- **Interactive Notebook**: Built and demonstrated on **Anaconda Jupyter Notebook**.

## Technologies Used
- Python üêç
- Jupyter Notebook üìí
- Automata Theory Concepts

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Layalghacham/TicTacToe-DFA.git
